# check-out-my-pet
A fullstack MERN social media project

Things to do later:
- make custom google sign in (either with vanilla code or reactoauth/google)
- move around elements to make it more unique
    - post: title on top, then createdat, then picture then message, then like and delete
    - post can be inside of a post-it looking container
    - change header picture to dog or someother pet (hamster?)
    - create modal for new posts instead of having it on the top right
    - change Form.js form's onChange attribute to one similar to the Auth.js form's onChange attribute which is much cleaner
